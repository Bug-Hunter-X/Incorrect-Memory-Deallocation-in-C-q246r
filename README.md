This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: attempting to free memory allocated on the stack. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code.  The correct approach, shown in `bugSolution.c`, is to only use `free()` on dynamically allocated memory (using `malloc`, `calloc`, etc.). Attempting to free stack allocated memory leads to undefined behavior and is a serious programming error.
